# youtubei

An isolated Rust crate embedding QuickJS and youtubei.js from npm. One `Innertube`
owns a reusable JavaScript instance; returned objects retain the same engine.
No application TypeScript or JavaScript bridge runs inside it.

From this directory, run `task test`, `task lint`, or `task build`. Each runs
`bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run bundle` first. Bundling is a single
bun build command in package.json. `generated/` and `node_modules/` are ignored by
Git. To use Cargo directly, run `task bundle` once first. A C toolchain builds
QuickJS through rquickjs. Bun is only needed for bundling, not at
runtime. Mazit depends on this crate with `youtubei = { path = "youtubei" }`.

The npm version is selected only by `package.json` and `bun.lock`; there is no
Rust version constant or runtime version switch. From the repository root,
`task test:youtube-versions` installs 18.0.0 and 18.1.0 into a
temporary directory, bundles each, and tests the same Rust crate. It also tests
the desktop integration for each release. Pass another set with
`task test:youtube-versions -- 18.0.0 18.1.0`.
The original bundle is restored afterwards; do not run this matrix alongside
other Cargo builds.

Bindings target the 18+ upstream API, including its errors. There are no 17.x
compatibility paths. The lockfile currently selects 18.1.0. Passing the matrix
establishes compatibility of the tested API surface; future upstream API changes
may still require binding updates.

```rust
use youtubei::{Innertube, SessionOptions, models::PlaylistItem};

# async fn example() -> youtubei::Result<()> {
let yt = Innertube::create(SessionOptions::local()).await?;
let mut page = yt.get_playlist("PLAYLIST_ID").await?;
loop {
    // One engine access for metadata, items, alerts and continuation state.
    let data = page.data().await?;
    for item in data.items {
        match item {
            PlaylistItem::PlaylistVideo(video) => println!("{}", video.title),
            PlaylistItem::LockupView(video) => println!("{}", video.content_id),
            PlaylistItem::Other { node_type } => eprintln!("Unsupported: {node_type}"),
        }
    }
    if !data.has_continuation { break; }
    page = page.get_continuation().await?;
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

`SessionOptions::default()` leaves upstream defaults intact (including network
session/player initialization). `SessionOptions::local()` explicitly disables
those startup requests. Multiple sessions can share an `Engine` with
`Innertube::create_in`; `Innertube::new(&session)` reuses an existing session.
Cloning a handle retains the same JS object. Dropping the final handle frees its
engine. Cross-engine arguments return an error.

The typed surface covers the upstream operations used by Mazit. These are
read-only projections of the fields it consumes, not complete copies of every
TypeScript declaration. Upstream methods still run on live JavaScript objects.

| Upstream | Rust |
| --- | --- |
| `Innertube.create`, `new Innertube(session)` | `Innertube::create`, `create_in`, `new` |
| `yt.getPlaylist`, `getChannel`, `getBasicInfo` | `get_playlist`, `get_channel`, `get_basic_info` |
| `yt.actions.execute('/browse', { browseId, params })` | `actions.browse(BrowseOptions { browse_id, params })` → `ApiResponse` |
| `new YT.Playlist(actions, response)` | `Playlist::new(&actions, &response, false)` |
| `page.getContinuation()` | `page.get_continuation().await?` → live `Playlist` |
| `page.info`, `page.items`, `page.page.alerts`, `page.has_continuation` | `page.data().await?` → owned `PlaylistData` in one context access |
| `PlaylistVideo \| LockupView \| …` | `PlaylistItem::{PlaylistVideo, LockupView, Other}` |
| `channel.metadata` | `channel.metadata().await?` → `ChannelMetadata` |
| `info.basic_info`, `playability_status`, `page[0].microformat`, `cpn` | `info.data().await?` → `VideoInfoData` in one context access |
| `info.streaming_data?.adaptive_formats` | `info.adaptive_formats().await?` → `Vec<Format>` with cached `FormatInfo` |
| `{ client: 'VISIONOS' }` | `GetVideoInfoOptions { client: Some(Client::VisionOs), ..Default::default() }` |
| `yt.session.player`, `Player.create` | `session().await?.player`, `set_player`, `Player::create` |
| `format.content_length`, `format.has_audio`, … | `format.info().content_length`, `format.info().has_audio`, …; no JS access |
| `format.decipher(player)` | `format.decipher(player.as_ref()).await?` → `String` |
| `text.toString()` in listing metadata | `TextValue` with `Display`, `as_str()`, `into_string()` |

`models` contains ordinary Rust structs, enums, `Option`, and `Vec`. Missing
metadata on unavailable entries and continuation pages stays optional. Unknown
node/content types stay explicit so the app can reject incomplete listings.
JavaScript numbers are read natively, preserving NaN (important for rejecting
invalid lengths); dates preserve epoch milliseconds. Text conversion invokes the
upstream `toString`, including its fallback behavior.

Owned snapshots are `Send + Sync`; live engine/object handles are not. Snapshots
remain usable after dropping the engine. `Format::info()` is captured when the
handle is returned; modifying the JS object through `as_value()` does not update
that snapshot. Cloning a format shares its metadata without recopying strings.

Small declarative Rust macros generate model readers and handle boilerplate.
They expand to statically dispatched native property reads, with no runtime
schema interpreter or JSON round trip. QuickJS execution, property lookup and
copying strings into owned Rust values still have a cost. Batch extraction avoids
repeated context access and intermediate persistent handles. Audio selection is
entirely over cached Rust fields, with the live format retained for deciphering.

Run `cargo run --release --example boundary_bench` in this crate to compare
identical snapshots of a parsed 100-item classic playlist. It checks equality,
warms both paths, and alternates 31 samples of 20 reads each. Startup, parsing and
network time are excluded; this measures the boundary, not end-to-end downloads.

The dynamic escape hatch is explicit: `as_value()` on handles, or
`Engine::exports` / `export`, with
`JsValue::get`, `set`, `call`, `apply`, and `construct`. Method calls preserve
`this` and await promises; values retain prototypes, getters, callbacks, streams,
and identity. `value_with` / `with` expose rquickjs for native Rust callbacks,
symbols, typed arrays, and other non-JSON values. `Argument::Undefined` is distinct
from JSON null. `deserialize` is an explicit data snapshot, not the call protocol.
This is **not a generated, statically typed translation of every TypeScript
declaration**. APIs outside the typed surface use these dynamic Rust operations.

Application policy stays in Rust: for Mazit's unavailable-inclusive flat listing,
call `Actions::browse` with `browse_id: "VL" + id` and `params: "wgYCCAA="`, then construct
`Playlist` and follow every continuation. See `examples/playlist.rs`. The crate
does not expand listing videos or choose an audio format for the application.
Mazit keeps channel HTML resolution, listing validation, publication dates, and
audio selection in `src/youtube/`. The app does not call Innertube's download or
stream APIs: its Rust download manager retains range requests and concurrency
slots. `Engine::fetch_with` accepts a Rust async HTTP
callback, so the app retains its reqwest client and cookie jar. Request and
response bodies cross this boundary as bytes, without JSON or base64 wrapping.

QuickJS handles are `!Send` and `!Sync`. Reuse them in a current-thread Tokio
runtime or a `LocalSet`; `tokio::join!` / `spawn_local` can overlap async calls in
one engine. For a multithreaded app, create each engine **inside a dedicated
worker thread**, send requests through channels, and return owned Rust data.
See the runnable, network-free `examples/workers.rs`. Never attach a JS instance
to an ordinary Tokio task that can migrate between executor threads. Rust media
downloads can run on the multithreaded executor after receiving a URL/metadata.
Mazit uses one dedicated thread with one engine and reusable Innertube session,
overlapping up to sixteen operations while they await network I/O. Each playlist
scan owns its continuation chain. Downloads remain on the app's existing worker
pool.

The crate embeds rquickjs 0.11 with LLRT 0.8.1-beta's Rust implementations of
fetch, streams, URL, events, timers, encoding, and crypto. Rust supplies
`Platform.load`, player evaluation, structured cloning, and caching. The complete
upstream `/cf-worker` entry point is bundled unchanged; Rust replaces its platform shim
after evaluation. `--keep-names` is required by the upstream parser.

For youtubei.js 18.1.0 and Bun 1.4.2, identical bundle settings produced 1,275,026
bytes for CF-worker, 1,275,473 for React Native, and 1,277,155 for web. CF-worker is
the smallest, although the difference after bundling is modest. Its platform shim
is replaced before use, so QuickJS does not need Cloudflare's `caches` API. No
upstream sources or generated bundles are checked into Git.

Tests run the real bundle offline: object lifetime/identity, independent workers,
overlapping promises, Rust callbacks, errors, flat continuation pages, VISIONOS
request construction, parser nodes, formats, and the platform hooks. They do not
establish compatibility of every upstream feature (e.g. account authentication).
LLRT implements a subset of browser APIs. Cancelling a Rust wait does not itself
abort a JavaScript operation; use the upstream AbortSignal/cancellation API when
needed, and drive background jobs with `Engine::idle` while using subscriptions.
Live validation on 2026-09-24 exercised Mazit's subscription, HTTP transport,
worker, crate, and database paths. All 504 entries of
`PLipBN7O7_H3oq9oDRWagdZUoBOV81GCkT` and all 12 uploads of `@RyanFleury` matched
yt-dlp's complete flat listings exactly, including order. Run
`bun run scripts/test-youtube-live.ts` from the repository root after preparation
to repeat it. No per-video expansion, media download, or imported cookies were
used.
